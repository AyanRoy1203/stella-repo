    Hey…i hope u r doing well…so i didnt complete the project..so it may not
    appear good…Suuurry 😁<br /><br />

    yeah so i wanted to tell u ki i know ki almost jabse itnternship ta start
    hoyche tui tabse hee Rahul bhaiya ke sath whatsapp pe kotha bolis, and i
    have seen the type of ur texts too so i get it now, that why this is so "
    Messy "...i dont want to write further on it…its my last msg to u so i want it
    to be good..so leaving it at that. <br /><br />

    So look whatever we had for the past 2 years was definitely very beautiful,
    it always will be very special for me, its good memories and i just wanna
    say I m not angry with you, I m not in love with you anymore but that doesnt
    mean that i hate u...its just that i m a little disappointed and obviously cuz i
    never expected things to end, not in a way like this atleast ..…but this will always be very special to me
    and u will always be special to me, my first crush, my first love.... i m sure with time things will get
    better, and i will be fine 😁👍🏻 <br /><br />

    And i also wanted to apologize to u for all the wrongs that i may have done,
    if i have ever hurt u in any kind of way, i m sorry for that, it may have
    happened unknowingly…i had always loved u and i had always wanted to just
    love u and support u and nothing else…so sorry if i have done something
    wrong, it was unknowingly and i never ever wanted to cause u any harm.<br /><br />

    Finally, all the very-very best for ur college life 👍🏻😊, make some really
    good friends, enjoy ur life, have fun and work hard, do some really good
    things and make ur parents proud 😊…..and a very-very happy 19th to u 🥳…may
    god bless u, give u abundant growth, success and lots and lots of happiness
    in life 😊 and advance me happy birthday for all ur birthdays, wishing u
    luck, growth, happiness and success 😁😊….if destiny may, we will cross
    paths again though i really wish not to, cuz it will be low-key awkward
    😂😂😂 but who knows 🤷🏻‍♂️😂. Until then Goodbye Dumbo 😝 👋🏻👋🏻 <br /><br />

    ~Yours Nalla 😂
